The goal of this paper is to create a methodology to predict industry sales, which exhibit a seasonal pattern, by using non-seasonal economic indicators. In terms of time periods, both short-term and long-term predictive models were constructed, ranging from one-quarter predictions to twenty-quarter predictions. The basic step-by-step process was: de-seasonalize the data set, choose the relevant economic indicators using various statistical techniques, make predictions with artificial neural networks, re-seasonalize the predictions, and compute the errors of the predictions.
