Evidence-based policymaking (EBP) involves the use of evidence collected by scientifically rigorous methods to inform the decision-making process. EBP has been utilized by both the U.S. and UK governments in the last few decades to replace the ideology-based policymaking process. In developing countries, EBP is less implemented due to the lack of resources and limited civil liberty. We utilize data visualization to complement the evidence-based approach to addressing policy issues in developing countries.
