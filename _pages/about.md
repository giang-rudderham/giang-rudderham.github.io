Hi! I'm Giang, currently Research Coordinator and Assistant Data Scientist at the International Strategy and Reconciliation Foundation.
I received my M.S. in statistics from the University of Iowa and my B.A. in mathematics from the College of Wooster (Ohio).

For the last 3 years, I have led an interdisciplinary team to conduct research on evidence-based policymaking, with a focus on developing countries. In a recent research project, I build an interactive data visualization to deconstruct energy usage in North Korea (using data from the 2008 North Korean Census). I also conduct a comparative analysis on electricity production in 4 countries: North Korea, South Korea, China, and the U.S. in order to provide an understanding of the common challenges in electricity production, and smart solutions utilized by OECD countries like South Korea and the U.S.
Besides my experience in research, I have taught college-level statistics classes (as a TA), provided consulting services to a Fortune 500 company, and worked as an editorial assistant for a literary magazine and a book on survey research forthcoming by Wiley. I am open to new opportunities that allow me to leverage my technical skills in data analysis and statistics to increase businesses' productivity and insight.

Technical skills: data visualization, data wrangling, statistics, git

Technical stack: R, Python(NumPy, Pandas, Re, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Requests, JSON, BeautifulSoup, Sqlite3), SQL (SQLite)

My toolbox: VIM, RStudio, LaTeX, Jupyter Notebook
