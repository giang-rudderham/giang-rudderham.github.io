STAT 1020 is an elective course in the Statistics Department, taken by students in many majors, including psychology, education, and fine arts. Concepts include: graphing techniques for presenting data, descriptive statistics, correlation, regression, prediction; logic of statistical inference, elementary probability models, estimation, and tests of significance.

I taught 4 discussion sections of about 100 students total throughout the semester. Each week, I led 4 hours of lecture, presenting sample problems, explaining concepts, and answering students' questions. I held 3 hours of office hours per week to offer extra help to students. I also graded quizzes and proctored exams.
